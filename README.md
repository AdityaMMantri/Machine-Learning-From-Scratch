# Machine Learning From Scratch

Welcome! This repository is dedicated to understanding the **inner workings of basic machine learning algorithms**.
Unlike traditional libraries that abstract away the logic, this project features **hardcoded implementations** to help you understand how machine learning works under the hood.

Although these implementations might not be as optimized as those provided by libraries like **scikit-learn**, they offer a **great overview of algorithm structure** and help build an intuitive understanding of how each part works, including the **impact of hyperparameter tuning**.

Most of the algorithms have been **tested and evaluated**, and with some adjustments depending on the dataset, they **closely match the accuracy** of equivalent models in scikit-learn.

What's Inside?

- Manually implemented ML algorithms  
- Line-by-line explanation in code comments  
- Simple and clean code structure  
- Ideal for students, beginners, and anyone curious about the math & logic behind ML  

Hope this helps!!!
