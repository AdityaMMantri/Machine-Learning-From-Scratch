# Machine Learning From Scratch

Welcome! This repository is dedicated to understanding the **inner workings of basic machine learning algorithms**.
Unlike traditional libraries that abstract away the logic, this project features **hardcoded implementations** to help you understand how machine learning really works under the hood.

What's Inside?

- Manually implemented ML algorithms  
- Line-by-line explanation in code comments  
- Simple and clean code structure  
- Ideal for students, beginners, and anyone curious about the math & logic behind ML  

Hope this helps!!!
